# Deep Reinforcement Learning with PyTorch

In this repository we will implement various deep reinforcement learning algorithms. 
The main objective is to provide a clean implementation of the deep learning algorithms for deep learning enthusiast who want to have a deeper understanding of RL algorithms 

## **Implemented Algorithms**
1. Cross entropy
2. Deep Q-Learning (DQN)
     - Naive DQN
     - DQN with target networks
3. Policy Gradient
